# Spring Swagger to Json
Document your API (Spring Rest)

Swagger is the worldâ€™s largest framework of API developer tools for the OpenAPI Specification(OAS), enabling development across the entire API lifecycle, from design and documentation, to test and deployment.

At the heart of the above tools is the OpenAPI Specification (formerly called the Swagger Specification). The specification creates the RESTful contract for your API, detailing all of its resources and operations in a human and machine readable format for easy development, discovery, and integration.
